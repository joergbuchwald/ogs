This is one of the benchmark examples with analytical solutions presented
 by Vogel/Massmann to test the implementation of thermohydromechanics.

A detailed description about this benchmark can be found in section 10.1 of
 the book
[Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical-Chemical Processes in Fractured Porous Media: Modelling and Benchmarking From Benchmarking to Tutoring](https://www.opengeosys.org/books/bmb-4/),
 one of the ogs Benchmark books (see the reference list below).

<!--
These benchmark examples test the implementation of
thermohydromechanics process with analytical solutions
presented by Vogel/Massmann.

A detailed description can be found in the ogs Benchmark books.
The following table links the ogs problem descriptions with its corresponding
chapters in the benchmark books.
