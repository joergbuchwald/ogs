## With Singularity

### Prerequisites

* Linux or [macOS](https://sylabs.io/singularity-desktop-macos/)
  * Note: You can run Singularity on Windows inside a virtual machine using [WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) or with [Vagrant](https://app.vagrantup.com/sylabs)
* A running [installation](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/quick_start.html#quick-installation-steps) of Singularity 3.0 or higher
  * Available on Eve (UFZ), `envinf1` (UFZ), Juwels (SC JÃ¼lich), Taurus (TU Dresden)

### Get a container image

#### Option: Download a release image (preferred)

Simply download an image from the [releases]({{< ref "/releases" >}}) page.

#### Option: Download image from the latest master-branch build

Simply download an image from the [latest master-branch build](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/jobs/artifacts/master/browse/ThirdParty/container-maker/_out/images?job=container) page.

### Run OGS inside a Container (called from outside)

```bash
# Linux only:
singularity exec --app ogs ogs-6.2.2-serial.sif ogs some/path/project.prj
```

This starts the container, mounts your home directory inside the container, passes the current working directory and runs the ogs executable (in your home directory which is mounted inside the container) with the passed project file. Everything works as expected and is transparent to the user. When ogs finishes the container stops and you returns to the host system.

The `--app ogs` selects a pre-defined execution environment in the container (i.e. setting the `PATH` to `/scif/apps/ogs/bin` in which all the executables are located). You could also (and **on macOS you have to**) run without the `--app`-parameter but then you had to specify the full executable path in the container:

```bash
# Works on macOS too:
singularity exec ogs-6.2.2-serial.sif /scif/apps/ogs/bin/ogs ...
```

Running a benchmark:

```bash
# Create output directories
mkdir -p _out _out_mpi
# Run serial benchmark
singularity exec --app ogs ogs-6.2.2-serial.sif ogs -o _out [ogs-sources]/Tests/Data/Mechanics/Linear/disc_with_hole.prj
# Run serial benchmark with output validation (via vtkdiff)
singularity exec --app ogs ogs-6.2.2-serial.sif ogs -o _out -r [ogs-sources]/Tests/Data/Mechanics/Linear [ogs-sources]/Tests/Data/Mechanics/Linear/disc_with_hole.prj
# Run parallel benchmark with MPI
mpirun -np 4 singularity exec --app ogs ogs-6.2.2-openmpi-2.1.2.sif ogs -o _out_mpi [ogs-sources]/Tests/Data/Mechanics/Linear/disc_with_hole.prj
```

You can run other contained executables as well, e.g. `vtkdiff`:

```bash
singularity exec --app ogs ogs-6.2.2-serial.sif vtkdiff --help
```

You can interactively explore the container with `singularity shell` (you can see that you are **in** the container because of the `Singularity [container image file]:...>` prefix of the shell):

```bash
# Shell into container
singularity shell ogs-6.2.2-serial.sif
# List files in the container
Singularity ogs-6.2.2-serial.sif:...> ls /scif/apps/ogs/bin
... ogs tetgen vtkdiff
# Exit the container and get back to your hosts shell
Singularity ogs-6.2.2-serial.sif:...> exit
```

### Custom Python environment for the container

For certain benchmarks or tutorials you may need additional Python packages. You can create a Python [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) inside the container (stored on your host) and install packages via `pip` (inside the container):

```bash
mkdir my-working-directory && cd my-working-directory
singularity shell my-container.sif

# Now in the container
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install numpy # or whatever you need
# run ogs
exit

# Now outside the container
# The virtualenv-directory .venv still persists
# If you want to run something in the container with exec, source the venv before:
singularity exec --app ogs my-container.sif bash -c 'source .venv/bin/activate && ogs ...'
```

### Run the DataExplorer inside a Container

* Get a Singularity container with the DataExplorer (has `-gui` in its name)
* `singularity exec --app ogs ogs-xxx-gui-xxx.sif DataExplorer`

You may use this container on e.g. `envinf1` with X11 forwarding (`ssh -XY envinf1`).

## With Docker

Although Singularity is the preferred container runtime you can use [Docker](https://www.docker.com) too.

### Prerequisites

* A running [installation of Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Run OGS inside a Docker container

* Get the container: `docker pull registry.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/ogs-serial`
* Start interactive container session: `docker run --rm -it registry.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/ogs-serial`
* Run ogs: `/scif/apps/ogs/bin/ogs --version`
* Exit the container: `exit`

You will notice that the interactive session in your container is isolated from your host, i.e. you do not have access to files on your host. You need to explicitly [mount](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) them on `docker run`:

```bash
mkdir ~/ogs_out
docker run --rm -it -v $HOME/code/ogs6/ogs/Tests/Data:/tmp/data:ro -v $HOME/ogs_out:/tmp/out registry.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/ogs-seria
/scif/apps/ogs/bin/ogs -o /tmp/out /tmp/data/Elliptic/cube_1x1x1_SteadyStateDiffusion/cube_1e4.prj
exit
ls ~/ogs_out
# [shows ogs generated output files]
```
