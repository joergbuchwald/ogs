## Download

Download the latest release of OpenGeoSys from the [Releases](/releases)-page. Be sure to pick the correct file for your operating system.

## Installation

OGS itself is a simple executable file so you can put it anywhere you like. For convenience you may put into a location which is in your `PATH`-environment variable which allows you to start the executable without specifying its full file path.

## Download benchmarks

You can download the latest benchmark files from GitLab:

- On our OGS repository on GitLab browse to the [Tests/Data](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/tree/master/Tests/Data)-folder
- Browse to the process subfolder you are interested in, e.g. [Elliptic](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/tree/master/Tests/Data/Elliptic) (1.)
- Find the Downloads-dropdown (2.)
- Choose an appropriate format under **Download this directory** (3.)
- Uncompress the downloaded file

See [the Benchmarks section](/docs/benchmarks/) for more information on the benchmarks.

## Running

OGS is a command line application and requires the path to a `.prj`-file as an argument.

::: {.win}
To run it open a new command line shell (called *cmd.exe*). Now simply type `ogs` (if the executable is in your `PATH`-environment variable) or specify its full path (e.g.: `C:\Users\MyUserName\Downloads\ogs.exe`) and hit `ENTER`.

OGS prints out its usage instructions:

```
PARSE ERROR:
             Required argument missing: project-file

Brief USAGE:
   ogs  [--] [--version] [-h] <PROJECT FILE>

For complete USAGE and HELP type:
   ogs --help
```

You can see that there is the project-file missing.

Then simply supply the path to a project file as an argument to the OGS executable:

```
$ ogs .\Path\to\BenchmarkName.prj
```
:::

::: {.linux}
To run it open a new command line shell (*Terminal*). Now simply type `ogs` (if the executable is in your `PATH`-environment variable) or specify its full path (e.g.: `./path/to/ogs`) and hit `ENTER`.

OGS prints out its usage instructions:

```
PARSE ERROR:
             Required argument missing: project-file

Brief USAGE:
   ogs  [--] [--version] [-h] <PROJECT FILE>

For complete USAGE and HELP type:
   ogs --help
```

You can see that there is the project-file missing.

Then simply supply the path to a project file as an argument to the OGS executable:

```
$ ogs ./path/to/BenchmarkName.prj
```
