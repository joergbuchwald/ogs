Option of coupling scheme:<br/>
<b>staggered_T_H_M</b>:  The equations of T, H, and M is solved individually in a
  coupling iteration, i.e the THM is solved by the fully staggered approach.
<br/>
<b>staggered_TH_M</b>: The equations T and H are solved monolithically, and the
  equation of M is solved solely in a coupling iteration.
<br/>
<b>monolithic</b>: The THM equations are solved by the monolithic approach.
